## Description

* This is the first project out of three to build a fully functioning Restaurant review app, and the sixth project in Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. This stage focuses mainly on accessibility, responsiveness and offline experience.

## Project Instructions

In this project, I'm converting a static webpage with no accessibility, responsiveness, offline features into a mobile-ready web application. The final result should be responsive on different sized displays, accessible for screen reader use and should have a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Installation and running

1. Visit the [project's page](https://3weeda.github.io/Restaurant-reviews-app-stage1/)
2. Clone or download the zip of this repository.
3. Open a terminal and cd into the root folder of this repository.
4. check python version by `python -V`
5. Start hosting your application on a local server:
  -For Python 2.x: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
  -For Python 3.x: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
6. Navigate to http://localhost:8000 and you should be able to see the app up and running.
